## Introduction

The Spec-Driven Workflow is a systematic approach to software development that transforms rough feature ideas into production-ready implementations through a structured three-phase process:

1. **Requirements Phase** - Define what needs to be built
2. **Design Phase** - Plan how it will be built
3. **Tasks Phase** - Break down the implementation into actionable steps

This methodology ensures thorough planning, maintains implementation context, and provides clear progress tracking throughout the development lifecycle.

### Key Benefits

- **Systematic Approach**: Structured workflow prevents missed requirements and design considerations
- **AI-Assisted Generation**: Intelligent document generation with research integration
- **Traceability**: Full traceability from requirements through implementation
- **Progress Tracking**: Granular progress monitoring and status updates
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation and approval workflows
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains full context for implementation decisions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using the spec-driven workflow, ensure you have:

1. **EcoCode Desktop Application** installed and running
2. **Orchestrator Service** running on port 8890
3. **Project Workspace** initialized with encryption
4. **AWS Bedrock Access** (optional, for AI-assisted generation)

### Accessing the Workflow

1. Open the EcoCode desktop application
2. Navigate to the **Spec Workflows** tab
3. Ensure the orchestrator service is healthy (green status indicator)

## Creating Your First Spec

### Step 1: Initiate Spec Creation

1. Click the **"Create New Spec"** button
2. Enter your feature idea in natural language
3. Optionally provide a custom feature name (kebab-case format)
4. Click **"Create Spec"**

**Example Feature Ideas:**
- "User authentication system with OAuth integration"
- "Real-time chat functionality with message history"
- "File upload system with virus scanning"
- "API rate limiting with Redis backend"

### Step 2: Review Generated Spec Structure

The system will automatically:
- Generate a unique spec ID
- Create the directory structure in `.kiro/specs/{feature-name}/`
- Initialize the workflow in the Requirements phase
- Generate an initial requirements document

## Understanding the Workflow

### Workflow Phases

The spec-driven workflow follows a strict sequential process:

```
Requirements â†’ Design â†’ Tasks â†’ Execution
     â†“           â†“        â†“        â†“
   Review    Research   Plan    Implement
```

### Phase Transitions

- **Explicit Approval Required**: Each phase must be explicitly approved before proceeding
- **Iterative Refinement**: You can request changes and iterate within each phase
- **Backward Navigation**: You can return to previous phases if needed
- **Context Preservation**: All decisions and rationale are preserved

### Status Indicators

- ðŸŸ¡ **Draft** - Initial creation, not yet reviewed
- ðŸ”µ **In Review** - Under review, awaiting approval
- ðŸŸ¢ **Approved** - Approved and ready for next phase
- ðŸŸ  **In Progress** - Active implementation
- âœ… **Completed** - All tasks finished
- ðŸ”´ **Error** - Requires attention

## Working with Requirements

### Requirements Document Structure

The requirements document follows the EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format:

```markdown
# Requirements Document

## Introduction
[High-level feature description and business context]

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: [Requirement Name]

**User Story:** As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN [event] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
2. IF [condition] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
3. GIVEN [precondition] WHEN [event] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
```

### Best Practices for Requirements

1. **Be Specific**: Use concrete, measurable criteria
2. **Consider Edge Cases**: Include error conditions and boundary cases
3. **Think Security**: Address authentication, authorization, and data protection
4. **Performance Matters**: Include performance and scalability requirements
5. **User Experience**: Consider usability and accessibility requirements

### Example Requirements

```markdown
### Requirement 1: User Authentication

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in securely, so that I can access my personal data

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate and redirect to dashboard
2. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an error message and log the attempt
3. IF a user fails authentication 5 times THEN the system SHALL temporarily lock the account for 15 minutes
4. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL create a secure session token with 24-hour expiration
```

### Reviewing and Approving Requirements

1. **Review Generated Content**: Carefully read the AI-generated requirements
2. **Request Changes**: Use the feedback feature to request modifications
3. **Iterate as Needed**: Continue refining until requirements are complete
4. **Explicit Approval**: Click "Approve Requirements" to proceed to design

## Designing Your Feature

### Design Document Structure

The design document includes comprehensive technical specifications:

- **Overview**: High-level architecture summary
- **Architecture**: System boundaries, data flow, technology stack
- **Components and Interfaces**: API definitions and interactions
- **Data Models**: Schemas, relationships, validation rules
- **Error Handling**: Error scenarios and recovery strategies
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing plans

### Research Integration

During design creation, the system automatically:
- Identifies research areas from requirements
- Gathers relevant technical information
- Incorporates findings into design decisions
- Provides source citations and references

### Design Review Process

1. **Automatic Generation**: AI creates initial design based on requirements
2. **Research Integration**: System conducts research and incorporates findings
3. **Review and Feedback**: Provide feedback on design decisions
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Modify design based on feedback
5. **Final Approval**: Approve design to proceed to task creation

## Managing Implementation Tasks

### Task List Structure

The task list breaks down implementation into manageable coding steps:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Set up project structure and core interfaces
  - Create directory structure for models, services, repositories
  - Define interfaces that establish system boundaries
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [ ] 2. Implement data models and validation
- [ ] 2.1 Create core data model interfaces and types
  - Write TypeScript interfaces for all data models
  - Implement validation functions for data integrity
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 3.3_
```

### Task Characteristics

- **Coding-Focused**: Only includes tasks that involve writing, modifying, or testing code
- **Incremental**: Each task builds on previous tasks
- **Traceable**: Every task references specific requirements
- **Testable**: Includes validation and testing steps
- **Actionable**: Specific enough for autonomous execution

### Task Review and Approval

1. **Generated Task List**: Review AI-generated implementation plan
2. **Sequence Validation**: Ensure logical task ordering
3. **Requirement Coverage**: Verify all requirements are addressed
4. **Feedback and Iteration**: Request changes if needed
