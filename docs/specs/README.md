# Spec-Driven Development Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for EcoCode's spec-driven development workflow. The spec-driven approach transforms rough feature ideas into production-ready implementations through a systematic three-phase process.

## Quick Start

### For Users
1. Read the [User Guide](../user-guide/spec-driven-workflow.md) for comprehensive workflow instructions
2. Check the [API Documentation](../api/specs-api.md) for technical integration details
3. Review [Setup Instructions](../setup/local.md) for environment configuration

### For Developers
1. Examine the [Architecture Overview](designs/README.md) for system design
2. Study the [Requirements Methodology](requirements/README.md) for EARS format
3. Understand [Task Management](tasks/README.md) for execution patterns

## Workflow Phases

### 1. Requirements Phase
- **Purpose**: Define what needs to be built
- **Format**: EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)
- **Output**: Structured requirements document with user stories and acceptance criteria
- **Approval**: Explicit user approval required to proceed

### 2. Design Phase
- **Purpose**: Plan how the feature will be built
- **Research**: Automated research integration for informed decisions
- **Output**: Comprehensive technical design with architecture, components, and testing strategy
- **Approval**: Design review and approval before task generation

### 3. Tasks Phase
- **Purpose**: Break down implementation into actionable coding steps
- **Characteristics**: Incremental, traceable, testable, and coding-focused
- **Output**: Hierarchical task list with requirement traceability
- **Execution**: Individual task execution with context awareness

## Best Practices

### Feature Scoping
- Start with well-defined, focused features
- Define clear boundaries and scope
- Plan for incremental delivery
- Focus on user value and experience

### Requirements Quality
- Use specific, measurable acceptance criteria
- Include comprehensive functional and non-functional requirements
- Address edge cases and error conditions
- Involve stakeholders in review process

### Design Excellence
- Establish clear architectural boundaries
- Choose appropriate technologies for the ecosystem
- Plan for scalability and performance
- Integrate security considerations throughout

### Task Management
- Ensure logical task sequencing and dependencies
- Use appropriate granularity (neither too large nor too small)
- Include testing and validation in task planning
- Maintain clear requirement traceability

### Execution Discipline
- Follow the sequential workflow process
- Complete tasks individually before proceeding
- Maintain full specification context
- Validate each task against requirements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Spec Creation Problems
- Check orchestrator service health
- Verify workspace permissions and disk space
- Review error logs for specific issues
- Ensure proper environment configuration

#### Document Generation Issues
- Provide detailed, specific feature descriptions
- Check AI service availability (AWS Bedrock)
- Review generated content for quality
- Use feedback mechanism for improvements

#### Task Execution Failures
- Verify prerequisite documents exist
- Check task dependencies are satisfied
- Review execution logs for errors
- Ensure proper development environment

### Debugging Resources
- Health check endpoints: `/health` and `/health/detailed`
- Log files: orchestrator logs and execution logs
- Performance monitoring: cache statistics and resource usage
- Validation reports: document and workflow validation results

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- Enable file and AI response caching
- Use appropriate task granularity
- Monitor system resource usage
- Implement proper cleanup procedures

### Scalability Planning
- Limit concurrent spec execution
- Monitor disk space usage
- Use progress tracking for resource management
- Consider breaking large features into smaller specs

### Resource Management
- Configure appropriate timeout values
- Monitor memory and CPU usage
- Implement proper error recovery
- Use health checks for monitoring

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- Proper access control and permissions
- Audit trail maintenance for compliance
- Secure communication channels

### Best Practices
- Avoid including sensitive data in specifications
- Use proper authentication and authorization
- Implement secure file handling
- Maintain security throughout the workflow
