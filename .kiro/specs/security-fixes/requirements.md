# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical security vulnerabilities and code quality issues identified through code review. The implementation focuses on fixing URL redirection vulnerabilities, path traversal issues, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, authorization bypasses, error handling gaps, and performance optimizations across the EcoCode platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the application to validate URLs before opening them externally, so that I'm protected from malicious redirections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on an external link THEN the system SHALL validate the URL before calling shell.openExternal()
2. WHEN an invalid or suspicious URL is detected THEN the system SHALL block the request and log the attempt
3. WHEN a valid URL is confirmed THEN the system SHALL proceed with opening it in the default browser

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want file operations to be protected against path traversal attacks, so that the system cannot access files outside intended directories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file paths are processed in file_manager.py THEN the system SHALL validate paths to prevent directory traversal
2. WHEN file paths are processed in workflow_persistence.py THEN the system SHALL sanitize input paths
3. WHEN an invalid path is detected THEN the system SHALL reject the operation and return an appropriate error
4. WHEN path validation passes THEN the system SHALL proceed with the file operation within the allowed directory

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want user input to be properly escaped in generated content, so that I'm protected from cross-site scripting attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user input is included in template generation THEN the system SHALL escape HTML characters
2. WHEN generating content in generators.py THEN the system SHALL sanitize all user-provided data
3. WHEN malicious script content is detected THEN the system SHALL neutralize it before rendering
4. WHEN content is safely processed THEN the system SHALL display it without security risks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want authorization checks to be performed server-side, so that security cannot be bypassed through client manipulation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN role-based access is required THEN the system SHALL validate permissions on the server
2. WHEN client-side role checks are encountered THEN the system SHALL replace them with server-side validation
3. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny the request and log the attempt
4. WHEN proper authorization is confirmed THEN the system SHALL allow the requested operation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent error handling throughout the application, so that failures are gracefully managed and don't crash the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made in orchestrator-client.ts THEN the system SHALL wrap them in try-catch blocks
2. WHEN IPC operations occur THEN the system SHALL handle potential errors gracefully
3. WHEN Electron process management fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error recovery
4. WHEN loading states are managed THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent patterns across components

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Levenshtein algorithm to be optimized for better performance, so that spec validation runs efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating string distances THEN the system SHALL use space-optimized algorithms
2. WHEN processing large strings THEN the system SHALL maintain O(min(m,n)) space complexity instead of O(m*n)
3. WHEN validation completes THEN the system SHALL provide results in reasonable time
4. WHEN memory usage is measured THEN the system SHALL show improved efficiency over the previous implementation
