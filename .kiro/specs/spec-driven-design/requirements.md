# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Spec-Driven Design feature is a comprehensive workflow orchestration system that transforms rough feature concepts into production-ready implementation plans through a structured, iterative process. This feature implements a three-phase methodology (Requirements → Design → Tasks) with explicit approval gates, comprehensive research integration, and intelligent task execution capabilities. The system ensures thorough documentation, maintains implementation context, and provides granular progress tracking for complex software development projects.

## Requirements
