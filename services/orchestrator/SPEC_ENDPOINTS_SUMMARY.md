# Spec-Driven Workflow API Endpoints Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of FastAPI endpoints for spec-driven workflow management as part of task 6 "Create FastAPI endpoints for workflow management".

## Implemented Endpoints

### 6.1 Spec Creation and Management Endpoints

- **POST /specs** - Create a new specification workflow from a feature idea
  - Request: `CreateSpecRequest` (feature_idea, optional feature_name)
  - Response: `SpecResponse` with created spec information
  - Status: ✅ Implemented

- **GET /specs** - List all available specification workflows
  - Response: `SpecListResponse` with list of specs and total count
  - Includes authorization filtering
  - Status: ✅ Implemented

- **GET /specs/{spec_id}** - Get detailed information about a specific specification
  - Response: `SpecDetailResponse` with documents, approvals, and metadata
  - Includes document loading from file system
  - Status: ✅ Implemented

### 6.2 Document Management API Endpoints

- **PUT /specs/{spec_id}/requirements** - Update requirements document
  - Request: `UpdateDocumentRequest` (content, optional approve, optional feedback)
  - Response: `UpdateDocumentResponse` with update status and checksum
  - Status: ✅ Implemented

- **PUT /specs/{spec_id}/design** - Update design document
  - Request: `UpdateDocumentRequest` (content, optional approve, optional feedback)
  - Response: `UpdateDocumentResponse` with update status and checksum
  - Status: ✅ Implemented

- **PUT /specs/{spec_id}/tasks** - Update tasks document
  - Request: `UpdateDocumentRequest` (content, optional approve, optional feedback)
  - Response: `UpdateDocumentResponse` with update status and checksum
  - Status: ✅ Implemented

### 6.3 Task Execution API Endpoints

- **POST /specs/{spec_id}/tasks/{task_id}/execute** - Execute a specific task
  - Request: `ExecuteTaskRequest` (optional task_description)
  - Response: `ExecuteTaskResponse` with execution status and log
  - Note: Placeholder implementation pending task execution engine integration
  - Status: ✅ Implemented (placeholder)

- **PUT /specs/{spec_id}/tasks/{task_id}/status** - Update task status
  - Request: `UpdateTaskStatusRequest` (status)
  - Response: `UpdateTaskStatusResponse` with updated status
  - Note: Placeholder implementation pending task execution engine integration
  - Status: ✅ Implemented (placeholder)

- **GET /specs/{spec_id}/progress** - Get progress information for a specification
  - Response: `ProgressResponse` with detailed progress metrics
  - Currently calculates basic progress based on workflow phase
  - Status: ✅ Implemented

### 6.4 Workflow Approval and State Management Endpoints

- **POST /specs/{spec_id}/approve/{phase}** - Approve or reject a workflow phase
  - Request: `ApprovePhaseRequest` (approved, optional feedback)
  - Response: `ApprovePhaseResponse` with approval status
  - Supports requirements, design, and tasks phases
  - Status: ✅ Implemented

- **GET /specs/{spec_id}/status** - Get current workflow status
  - Response: `WorkflowStatusResponse` with detailed workflow state
  - Includes valid transitions and approval status
  - Status: ✅ Implemented

## Key Features Implemented

### Security and Authorization
- Integrated with existing authorization system
- User context validation for all operations
- Permission-based access control (spec:read, spec:create, workflow:transition, workflow:approve)
- Audit logging for all authorization events

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Validation errors for malformed requests (422)
- Authorization errors (403)
- Resource not found errors (404)
- Internal server errors (500)

### Data Models
- Complete Pydantic schemas for all request/response models
- Type safety and validation
- Consistent error response format

### Integration
- Seamlessly integrated with existing FastAPI application
- Uses existing dependency injection patterns
- Compatible with existing workspace and AWS endpoints

## File Structure

```
services/orchestrator/eco_api/
├── specs/
│   └── router.py              # New FastAPI router with all spec endpoints
├── schemas.py                 # Updated with spec-related schemas
└── main.py                    # Updated to include specs router
```

## Requirements Addressed

- **1.1, 1.2**: Spec creation and management endpoints ✅
- **7.9**: Spec listing and discovery ✅
- **5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6**: Document management endpoints ✅
- **4.5, 4.8**: Task execution endpoints ✅ (placeholder)
- **6.1, 6.2, 6.9**: Task execution and progress tracking ✅
- **1.8, 1.9**: Workflow approval handling ✅
- **5.10**: Approval workflow management ✅
- **8.2, 8.3**: Error handling and validation ✅

## Testing

- Created comprehensive test suite (`test_specs_router.py`)
- Integration testing confirms all endpoints are accessible
- Proper error handling validation
- Authorization system integration verified

## Next Steps

1. **Task Execution Engine Integration**: The task execution endpoints currently have placeholder implementations. They need to be integrated with the actual task execution engine once task 5.x is completed.

2. **Enhanced Progress Calculation**: The progress endpoint currently calculates basic progress based on workflow phase. This should be enhanced to calculate actual progress based on task completion when the task execution engine is integrated.

3. **Real Authentication**: The current implementation uses a placeholder user context. In production, this should be replaced with proper JWT token validation or session-based authentication.

## Notes

- All endpoints follow RESTful conventions
- Consistent error handling and response formats
- Full integration with existing authorization system
- Placeholder implementations clearly marked for future enhancement
- Comprehensive logging and audit trails
